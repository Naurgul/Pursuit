# 	1 = one predator in same cell as the prey           
# 	2 = prey has to be surrounded by four predators 		
# 	3 = prey has to be surrounded by two predators			
# 	4 = prey had to be surrounded by two predators in the previous turn and
#     	exactly one predator moves to the position of the prey in the current turn
