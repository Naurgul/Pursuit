Lab Course

This lab course consists of two assignments about the predator-prey simulator (pursuit domain). In each assignment you have to program the behavior of the predators to capture the preys as quickly as possible. In addition, for each assignment a small report (4 or 5 pages) needs to be written in Dutch or English, where you present your approach and results. 

Assignments

Before you start on the assignments, read the assignment introduction first. Important: make sure you use the default settings in pursuit.conf file for ALL assignments. The default settings are given in the introduction.
